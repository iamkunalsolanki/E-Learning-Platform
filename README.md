## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-learning-platform.git
cd e-learning-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

## 🏗️ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist/` or `build/` folder (depending on your bundler).

---

## 🌐 Serve the Production Build

First, install the `serve` package globally (only once):

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

Then run:

```bash
serve -s dist
```

Or, if using React with Create React App:

```bash
serve -s build
```

This will serve your app at `http://localhost:5000` by default.
